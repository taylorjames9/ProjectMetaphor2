## AdMob

The AdMob Unity plugin is distributed separately and is available from the
[AdMob Get Started](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/unity/start) guide.

## Stub Implementations

Stub (non-functional) implementations are provided for convenience when
building for Windows, OSX and Linux so that you don't need to conditionally
compile code when also targeting the desktop.

Setup
-----

You need to follow the
[SDK setup instructions](https://firebase.google.com/preview/unity).
Each Firebase package requires configuration in the
[Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/console).  If you fail to
configure your project your app's initialization will fail.

      is selected and auto-resolution is enabled.
    - Improved error messages in the editor plugin.
  - Known Issues
    - Proguard is not integrated into Android builds. We have distributed
      proguard files that can be manually integrated into Android builds
      within AAR files matching the following pattern in each
      Unity package:
      `Firebase/m2repository/com/google/firebase/firebase-*-unity/*firebase-*.srcaar`
    - Incompatible AARs are not resolved correctly when building for Android.
      This can require manual intervention when using multiple plugins
      (e.g Firebase + AdMob + Google Play Games).  A workaround is documented
      on the
      [AdMob Unity plugin issue tracker](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-unity/issues/314).
